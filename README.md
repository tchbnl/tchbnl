Hello and welcome to my GitHub. I sometimes share stuff here that for some reason I think is presentable. Here's some of my stuff:

* [raNdoM](https://github.com/tchbnl/random): Random scripts and stuff
* [telcheck](https://github.com/tchbnl/telcheck): The first actual script I ever made. It uses Telnet to check remote mail servers for blocks. Works, but needs a rewrite.
* [MSP.sh](https://github.com/tchbnl/MSP.sh): It's kind of like cPanel's MSP but for Postfix. Might rewrite it sometime.
* [CWP Tools](https://github.com/tchbnl/cwptools): Tools I made to make CWP a little more tolerable

Please keep in mind I only learned Bash scripting in like the last year and change. That means:
