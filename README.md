*"Is it written in Bash" - Coworker after I submitted a new tool to roll out across the fleet*

Hello and welcome to my GitHub. I sometimes share stuff here that I think is presentable. Here's some of it:

* [raNdoM](https://github.com/tchbnl/alpaca): Simple Apache domlog parser because I'm too stupid to use GoAccess
* [telcheck](https://github.com/tchbnl/telcheck): The first actual Bash script I ever made. It uses telnet to check remote mail servers for blocks. Kinda works still, but it really needs a rewrite.
* [MSP.sh](https://github.com/tchbnl/MSP.sh): Think cPanel's MSP but for Postfix. It also needs a rewrite. I'm noticing a pattern.
* [CWP Tools](https://github.com/tchbnl/cwptools): Tools I made to make CWP a little more tolerable

Please keep in mind I only learned Bash scripting in like the last sixteen months. That means:
